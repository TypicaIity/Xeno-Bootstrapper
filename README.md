# Xeno Bootstrapper

The **Xeno Bootstrapper** is a utility designed to assist in the installation and initialization of the **Xeno** executor. This bootstrapper ensures that all prerequisites, configurations, and dependencies required for **Xeno** are properly set up before the main application is launched.

## Features
- **Dependency Management**: Automatically checks and installs missing dependencies required (Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable and .NET 8.0 Runtime).
- **Efficient Installation**: Minimizes the number of steps required to get **Xeno** up and running on your machine.
- **Automatic Updates**: Automatically checks for bootstrapper and **Xeno** updates and installs them.

## Installation

### Requirements
- A 64-bit installation of Windows 10/Windows 11
- Administrative rights (may be required for certain actions on your system)

### Download & Setup
1. Go to the [Xeno Bootstrapper Release Page](https://github.com/TypicaIity/silly-bootstrapper/releases) and download the latest version.
2. Run the executable file you just downloaded.

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues during the installation or while using the bootstrapper, try the following steps:

1. Ensure that you have administrative privileges.
2. If a dependency fails to install, manually install it and rerun the bootstrapper.
4. Refer to [xeno's issues](https://github.com/Riz-ve/Xeno/issues) or [bootstrapper issues](https://github.com/TypicaIity/Xeno-Bootstrapper/issues) for more assistance.
